## My Unity Game
The samples were already there, so i took a bit of help from it
my contributions - 
animations, a few scripts, the entire logic of scripts,
music, be it coin collecting, player attcking, enemy attacking,
button clicking sound effect on main menu, background music,
and complete enemy AI model- its running, the dealdamage function... once you play the game you'll know,
the main menu,
scene management script,
using tiles to edit the level,
coins collecting mechanism,
level complete/game obver panels.
